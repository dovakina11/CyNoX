# utils/__init__.py

"""
The utils package provides utility functions and modules for the CyNoX application.

Modules:
- crypto: Handles encryption and decryption of messages using strong cryptographic algorithms.
- invitation: Provides functionality for generating and validating secure invitation links.
"""

from .crypto import encrypt_message, decrypt_message
```

### Step 4: Review the Code
- **Functionality**: The `__init__.py` file initializes the `utils` package and exposes the `encrypt_message` and `decrypt_message` functions from the `crypto` module. This aligns with the conventions of making utilities easily accessible.
- **Conventions**: The file includes a docstring describing the purpose of the package and its modules, following Python best practices.
- **Dependencies**: The file imports functions from `crypto.py`, which is already implemented in the codebase.

### Final Output
